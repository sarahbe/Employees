    <h3>Few points to remember when using the application </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add new department, then you are ready to add employees. (you can try to add employee first, you will get a warning message! 😎 )
        </li>
        <li>You can enter the salaries on employees page.🤑 </li>
        <li>Add vacations as you like, but remember you only have 30 days available. There is no restriction on the system for vacations over 30 days, we will just warn you 🤓 </li>
    </ul>
